    <h2>Liability for content</h2>
    <p>
      The contents of this website were created with great care. However, I cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the content. As a service provider, I am responsible for my own content on these pages pursuant to § 7(1) TMG. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, I am not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. Liability in this respect, however, is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon becoming aware of any such legal violations, I will remove the content immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>Liability for links</h2>
    <p>
      This website contains links to external third-party websites, over whose content I have no control. Therefore, I cannot assume any liability for this external content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. No illegal content was recognizable at that time. Permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation. If I become aware of any such infringements, I will remove such links immediately.
